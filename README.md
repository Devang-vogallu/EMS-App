This is a mobile application implemented using Jetpack compose for frontend and for Backend API's I have used Spring boot.
There is only pre-requisite for this process which is we have to create a Database in Mysql named "EmpDB".
The run process will be as follows
-->create database EmpDB.
-->import the project from Springboot Branch in STS and run it simply.
-->import the project from Kotlin Branch in Android studio and run it.
